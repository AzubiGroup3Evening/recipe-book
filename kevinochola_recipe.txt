### Le Gratin Dauphinois Recipe

#### Ingredients:

- 2 lbs (about 900g) russet potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and halved
- 2 cups (480 ml) heavy cream
- 1 cup (240 ml) whole milk
- 1 ½ cups (150g) Gruyère cheese, grated
- 1 ½ cups (150g) Emmental cheese, grated (or substitute with more Gruyère)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- A pinch of nutmeg (optional)
- Butter, for greasing the baking dish

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat the Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Butter a large baking dish or gratin dish generously to prevent sticking.

2. **Prepare the Potatoes:** Peel the potatoes and slice them thinly, about 1/8-inch thick. You can use a mandoline slicer for even slices, but be careful with your fingers.

3. **Infuse the Cream:** In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the heavy cream, milk, garlic cloves, salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg (if using). Heat the mixture until it's warm, but not boiling. This step infuses the cream with garlic flavor.

4. **Layer the Gratin:** Arrange a layer of sliced potatoes in the bottom of the buttered baking dish, slightly overlapping the slices. Remove the garlic cloves from the warm cream mixture and discard. Pour a portion of the warm cream mixture over the potatoes, ensuring they are well-coated. Sprinkle a generous amount of grated Gruyère and Emmental cheese over the layer. Repeat the layers until you've used all the potatoes, finishing with a layer of cheese on top.

5. **Bake the Gratin:** Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 50-60 minutes or until the potatoes are tender, and the top is golden brown and bubbly. You can test the potatoes' doneness by inserting a knife; it should go through the layers easily.

6. **Let it Rest:** Once done, remove the gratin from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving. This allows the cream to thicken slightly, making it easier to serve.

7. **Serve and Enjoy:** Serve the Gratin Dauphinois hot as a side dish with roasted meats, poultry, or enjoy it on its own as a comforting meal.
